# Enabling Platform Attestation via Redfish on Hydra BMC

# 1. Overview

This document proposes a platform attestation architecture via Redfish with Hydra BMC as the Platform RoT (PA-RoT). The proposed solution enables secure, standards-based attestation of device firmware and configuration by leveraging:

- **BMC as Platform RoT**: Central trust anchor collecting measurements from all end devices via the SPDM daemon
- **TIP (Trusted Integrated Processor) Signing**: Compound measurements cryptographically signed by the hardware RoT to prove report authenticity to remote attestation services
- **DMTF SPDM Protocol**: Standards-based secure communication for device authentication and measurement collection
- **Extended Redfish APIs**: Custom actions supporting compound measurement operations and TIP signing workflows

# 2. High-Level Architecture

## Components

- **OpenBMC Normal World**

  - **SPDM Daemon**: Central service managing SPDM protocol exchanges, device discovery, measurement collection, compound measurement aggregation, and invoke TIP signing. Communicates with TIP hardware via MCTP mailbox for signing operations.
  - **Redfish Service (bmcweb)**: Translates Redfish API requests into SPDM operations, exposes attestation data to clients
  - **MCTP Daemon**: Handles transport of SPDM messages over PCIe, I2C, I3C, USB, SPI etc.
  - **PLDM Daemon**: Maintains inventory and associations for SPDM-capable devices.
  - **Logging Daemon**: Used to log diagnostic information related to the operations of the SPDM Daemon.

- **Backend Security Processor**

    - **TIP (Trusted Integrated Processor)**: Hardware RoT providing cryptographic signing for compound measurements, holds device identity endorsed by HKMS.

## Platform RoT Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Device Discovery** | Discover all SPDM-capable endpoints via MCTP and PLDM |
| **Measurement Collection** | Collect signed measurements from each endpoint via SPDM |
| **Measurement Aggregation** | Aggregate individual measurements into compound measurements |
| **TIP Signing** | Request TIP to sign compound measurements for platform attestation |
| **Certificate Management** | Manage endpoint certificates and trust chains |
| **Attestation Response** | Provide complete attestation evidence to verifiers via Redfish |

# 3. End-to-End Data Flow

## Phase 1: Discovery & Initialization

On BMC boot, the SPDM Daemon discovers all SPDM-capable endpoints and establishes secure communication channels.

1. SPDM Daemon queries MCTP daemon for available endpoints
2. PLDM daemon provides inventory information and associations
3. SPDM Daemon performs handshake with each SPDM-capable device
4. D-Bus objects are created for each discovered endpoint

    participant PLDM as PLDM Daemon
    participant Overlake as Overlake eRoT

    participant OtherErot as Other eRoT

    Note over SPDM,OtherErot: Discovery & Initialization (On BMC Boot)

    PLDM-->>SPDM: Device Inventory with Associations

    par SPDM Handshake with All Devices
        SPDM->>Overlake: SPDM GET_VERSION, GET_CAPABILITIES, NEGOTIATE_ALGORITHMS
        Overlake-->>SPDM: Version, Capabilities, Algorithms
        SPDM->>Caliptra: SPDM GET_VERSION, GET_CAPABILITIES, NEGOTIATE_ALGORITHMS

        SPDM->>OtherErot: SPDM GET_VERSION, GET_CAPABILITIES, NEGOTIATE_ALGORITHMS
        OtherErot-->>SPDM: Version, Capabilities, Algorithms
    end

    SPDM->>SPDM: Create D-Bus Objects for Each Endpoint
```

## Phase 2: Initial Measurement Collection

After discovery, the SPDM Daemon collects initial measurements from all devices and caches them for quick access.

5. SPDM Daemon collects measurements from all devices
6. Measurements are cached in D-Bus properties for quick access

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber 5
    participant SPDM as SPDM Daemon
    participant Overlake as Overlake eRoT
    participant Caliptra as Caliptra RoT
    participant OtherErot as Other eRoT

    Note over SPDM,OtherErot: Initial Measurement Collection

    par Collect Initial Measurements
        SPDM->>Overlake: SPDM GET_MEASUREMENTS (all indices)
        Overlake-->>SPDM: Signed Measurements
        SPDM->>Caliptra: SPDM GET_MEASUREMENTS (all indices)
        Caliptra-->>SPDM: Signed Measurements
        SPDM->>OtherErot: SPDM GET_MEASUREMENTS (all indices)
        OtherErot-->>SPDM: Signed Measurements
    end

    SPDM->>SPDM: Cache Measurements in D-Bus Properties
```

## Phase 3: Remote Attestation Request

When a remote verifier requests attestation, the request flows through bmcweb to the SPDM Daemon, which collects fresh measurements.

7. Verifier sends attestation request via Redfish API
8. bmcweb translates request to D-Bus call
9. SPDM Daemon collects fresh measurements with provided nonce

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber 7
    participant Verifier as Remote Verifier
    participant BMCWeb as bmcweb (Redfish)
    participant SPDM as SPDM Daemon
    participant Overlake as Overlake eRoT
    participant Caliptra as Caliptra RoT
    participant OtherErot as Other eRoT

    Note over Verifier,OtherErot: Remote Attestation Request

    Verifier->>BMCWeb: POST GetPlatformCompoundMeasurements (nonce, deviceList)
    BMCWeb->>SPDM: D-Bus: GetCompoundMeasurements(nonce, devices, indices)

    Note over SPDM: Validate Request Parameters

    par Fresh Measurement Collection (if required)
        SPDM->>Overlake: SPDM GET_MEASUREMENTS (with nonce)
        Overlake-->>SPDM: Signed Measurements
        SPDM->>Caliptra: SPDM GET_MEASUREMENTS (with nonce)
        Caliptra-->>SPDM: Signed Measurements
        SPDM->>OtherErot: SPDM GET_MEASUREMENTS (with nonce)
        OtherErot-->>SPDM: Signed Measurements
    end

    SPDM->>SPDM: Aggregate Measurements
    SPDM->>SPDM: Compute Aggregate Hash (SHA-384)
```

## Phase 4: TIP Signing

The SPDM Daemon requests the TIP (Hardware RoT) to sign the compound measurement, providing platform-level attestation.

10. SPDM Daemon aggregates measurements and computes hash
11. TIP signs the compound measurement with platform key
12. TIP returns signature and certificate chain

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber 10
    participant SPDM as SPDM Daemon
    participant TIP as TIP (Hardware RoT)

    Note over SPDM,TIP: TIP Signing

    SPDM->>TIP: SignCompoundMeasurement Request
    Note over TIP: Verify SPDM Daemon Authorization
    TIP->>TIP: Create Signing Blob (hash + nonce + timestamp)
    TIP->>TIP: Sign with Platform Attestation Key
    TIP-->>SPDM: TIP Signature + Certificate Chain
```

## Phase 5: Response Assembly & Delivery

The SPDM Daemon assembles the complete response and bmcweb formats it as a Redfish response for the verifier.

13. SPDM Daemon assembles complete response
14. bmcweb formats and returns Redfish response

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber 13
    participant Verifier as Remote Verifier
    participant BMCWeb as bmcweb (Redfish)
    participant SPDM as SPDM Daemon

    Note over Verifier,SPDM: Response Assembly & Delivery

    SPDM->>SPDM: Assemble CompoundMeasurement Response
    SPDM-->>BMCWeb: D-Bus Response: CompoundMeasurement
    BMCWeb->>BMCWeb: Format Redfish Response
    BMCWeb-->>Verifier: Redfish Response (JSON)
```

## Phase 6: Verification (Client-side)

The remote verifier validates all cryptographic signatures and compares measurements against known-good values.

15. Verifier validates all signatures and certificates
16. Measurements compared against known-good values

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber 15
    participant Verifier as Remote Verifier

    Note over Verifier: Verification (Client-side)

    Verifier->>Verifier: Verify TIP Signature
    Verifier->>Verifier: Verify Individual Device Signatures
    Verifier->>Verifier: Validate Certificate Chains
    Verifier->>Verifier: Compare Measurements to Golden Values
```

# 4. Compound Measurements with TIP Signing

## Motivation

Modern platforms require attestation of multiple devices and a holistic view of platform integrity. Individual device measurements are insufficient for:

- Verifying the overall platform security posture
- Detecting coordinated attacks across multiple components
- Providing a single attestation evidence for platform trust decisions

## TIP's Role

The TIP is the hardware RoT that:

- **Holds Cryptographic Device Identity**: Contains unique device identity keys, endorsed by HKMS
- **Performs Cryptographic Signing**: Signs compound measurements with platform-level attestation keys
- **Maintains Secure Storage**: Protects private keys and critical security data
- **Provides Freshness**: Includes nonce and timestamp in signatures

## Compound Measurement Flow

    participant DeviceN as Other eRoTs

    end

| `TIPStatus` | `s` | TIP communication status (Online/Offline/Error) |

## D-Bus Example Usage

```bash
# Get compound measurements for all devices (includes TIP signing)
busctl call xyz.openbmc_project.SPDM \
    /xyz/openbmc_project/SPDM/CompoundMeasurement \
    xyz.openbmc_project.SPDM.CompoundMeasurement \
    GetCompoundMeasurements ayasau \

    1 255

# Get TIP certificate chain
busctl call xyz.openbmc_project.SPDM \
    /xyz/openbmc_project/SPDM/CompoundMeasurement \
    xyz.openbmc_project.SPDM.CompoundMeasurement \
    GetTIPCertificateChain

# Check TIP communication status
busctl get-property xyz.openbmc_project.SPDM \
    /xyz/openbmc_project/SPDM/CompoundMeasurement \
    xyz.openbmc_project.SPDM.CompoundMeasurement \
    TIPStatus
```

# 7. Security Considerations

## Cryptographic Requirements

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Hash Algorithm** | SHA-384 (TPM_ALG_SHA384) |
| **Signing Algorithm** | ECDSA with P-384 curve |
| **Nonce Size** | 32 bytes (256 bits) |
| **Certificate Format** | X.509 v3, DER or PEM encoded |
| **Key Storage** | TIP secure storage (hardware-protected) |

## Security Properties

1. **Authenticity**: All measurements are cryptographically signed
2. **Integrity**: Aggregate hash prevents tampering with individual measurements
3. **Freshness**: Nonce and timestamp ensure replay protection
4. **Non-repudiation**: TIP signature provides platform-level attestation
5. **Confidentiality**: SPDM secure sessions for measurement transport (optional)

## Threat Mitigations

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Measurement Tampering | Cryptographic signatures from each device and TIP |
| Replay Attack | Fresh nonce provided by verifier, timestamp in signature |
| Man-in-the-Middle | SPDM authenticated sessions, certificate validation |
| Unauthorized Access | D-Bus access control, Redfish authentication |
| Key Compromise | Hardware-protected keys in TIP, certificate revocation |
